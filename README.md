# opencv-stitching
19年时候的毕业设计，图像拼接，sift

下载完，打开 ConsoleApplication3
找到main函数进去，即可找到相关的文件，仅完成了图像特征点检测，匹配，融合的功能，
矫正柱面投影等内容没有做到。

特征点用sift算法，代码可以结合网上讲解自己阅读下

图片的类型只支持bmp，用CImg的缺点，那个jpg工具链接哪位大佬做到了和我交流下，谢谢

# opencv-stitching
Undergraduate graduation project in 19 years, image stitching, sift

After downloading, open ConsoleApplication3
Find the main function ,and then, you can find the relevant files.Only complete the image feature point detection, matching, and fusion functions.
Contents such as correcting cylindrical projection were not achieved.

The feature points use the sift algorithm, and the code can be combined with online explanations to read by yourself

The type of picture only supports bmp, the disadvantage of using CImg, the jpg tool link, which big guy has done it, talk to me, thank you.
